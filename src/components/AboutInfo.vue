      <p style="text-align: start; font-size: 20px;">I am a hard-working, inquisitive and creative-thinking individual. I always try to stimulate my brain,
        learn new things and be productive. Furthermore, I enjoy helping others and working together to solve
        issues. I&#39;m introverted, but I try to push myself out of my comfort zone so that I can experience new
        people and things.</p><br>

        <p style="color:crimson; text-align: start; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Where did your passion for coding start:</p>
        <p style="text-align: start; font-size: 20px;">
          My passion for the tech industry came from video games. I was always curious when I went into game
          directory files and saw things like sprites, models and background images and wondered how it was
          pieced together to make the games I enjoyed. Eventually, I started watching videos on YouTube,
          people showing how they would make games and websites from scratch and I figured that it was
          something I&#39;d enjoy doing.</p>
